Stochastic Skeleton Model

code by Sulian Thual 

Matlab code to integrate a Stochastic Skeleton Model for the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and perform several analysis.

references: github: https://github.com/sulianthual/stochasticskeleton

Introduction: 

The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a major climate phenomena in the tropical atmosphere. The stochastic skeleton model simulates the phenomena and provides important theoretical understanding. The model is described in details in a scientific article: 

Thual, S., A. J. Majda, and S. N. Stechmann, 2014: A Stochastic Skeleton Model for the MJO, J. Atmos. Sci., 71, 697-715

as well as in several subsequent articles by the same authors. 



Instructions: 

1) You need matlab installed.

2) Follow the file Instructions.pdf in the folder ./documentation on how to run and analyze the model.
